# California-Auto-Store-WebApp
Operating within a team of 6 members we set out to create a web application for a client for our senior project that created a database for our clients business of dismantling cars for parts and selling them. Using this database our client was able to manage their inventory by enabling them to sort or search through their stock based on filters. It also allows them to also add new parts to new parent categories or add parts to an existing category. Due to difficulties throughout the semester regarding its implementation we were not able to fully flesh out selling directly to ebay within the application, however we were able to include basic functionality using an older eBay API. Connected to eBay the client is also able to view basic statistics and analytics according to their requirements specifications.
